Content waring: brief discussion of sexual assault, racist caricatures shown

For this week, I’m talking about the Elsie Sinclair Hodge bench that sits between Guild and Dalton. It’s a giant, white stone bench; however, despite its size the bench is often overlooked on our campus. If anyone ever took a closer look at it, they would see that the inscription on the bench reads “alum Elsie Sinclair Hodge died in the Massacre of Christians at Paotingfu China June 1900.” Quite the inscription. This certainly piqued my interest and I couldn’t help but wonder who this woman was and how she ended up in China during the Boxer Rebellion.
