### Who Built Bryn Mawr? 2023-2026

*Who Built Bryn Mawr? 2023-2026* is an iteration of the Who Built Bryn Mawr? project that focuses on researching Asian histories at the college, from its founding to the present day. Each year, student interns will research and curate a small exhibit, intervention on campus, reparative object labels, or other projects within a smaller area of interest and keep a blog to document their research. 

‘Asian histories’ is a broad topic, and there are so many stories that have not been told in Bryn Mawr’s official histories. This four year project allows the time and space for deeper research into unresearched and lesser known stories that deeply affect the college today. At the end of the four-year timeline, a large exhibit encompassing all of the research that has been done will be created. 


### Who Built Bryn Mawr? Disoriented, The First Asian Students 1889-1924 (Summer 2023)

*Disoriented, The First Asian Students 1889-1924* explores the early history of Japanese and Chinese students at Bryn Mawr, a history colored by prevailing stereotypes about East Asian people that were circulating on Bryn Mawr’s campus, Philadelphia, and the country at large. At the turn of the 20th century, Bryn Mawr began accepting Chinese and Japanese students through designated scholarship programs. But were these programs actually intended to benefit Asian students? What would their experiences have been like?​

While there are gaps in the College Archive about the actual lived experience of the early East Asian students, this exhibition aims to imagine those experiences through historical context both on the local and national scale. Asian students arrived on a campus decorated with Orientalist Asian motifs and to an administrative and student body that harbored anti-Asian sentiments. By sharing the eugenicist and racist speeches of M. Carey Thomas, as well as student plays promoting negative stereotypes of Japanese and Chinese people, this exhibition serves as an important reminder that anti-Asian racism exists around us, visibly and invisibly, both in the past and present.
