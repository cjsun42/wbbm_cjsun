Although it began as a five-room cottage, by the time of her death in 1935, M. Carey Thomas had transformed her home, The Deanery, into an opulently appointed mansion. Thomas collected furniture and art from China, Japan, Egypt, India, and Syria for her home and garden, despite regularly expressing her hatred for non-white people and her support for eugenics in her journals, letters, and even public speeches. ​

Thomas' collection of Asian art revealed a larger system of Orientalism. White Europeans and Americans often collected art, especially Asian art, while supporting policies that excluded the very people who made it. Imitations of Asian antiquities were mass produced for department stores and sold as authentic to fashionable white households. Rather than appreciation, its display reinforced imperialism and Western dominance over an imagined primitive and unchanging Asia. This art, everywhere in the Deanery, surrounded everyone who entered – including students, staff, and faculty of the college.
