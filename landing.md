<a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/about-college/history/bryn-mawr-histories/who-built-bryn-mawr"><strong>Who Built Bryn Mawr?</strong></a> is an ongoing project that supports research and curatorial opportunities for students interested in changing the way the College understands its history. Over its 135+ years, the College has been sustained by countless individuals â€” not just the presidents, trustees, and donors memorialized on campus. Who are the people whose contributions have been forgotten, or too long overlooked? How can we tell their stories? How can we commemorate them?
